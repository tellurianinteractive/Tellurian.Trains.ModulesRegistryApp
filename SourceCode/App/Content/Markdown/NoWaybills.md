# No waybills?
Waybills can be created in two ways:
- For a specific meeting layout.
- As waybills reusableat several meetings.

There can be several reasons why no waybills are displayed for printing for the station:

## Meeting layout waybills
Meeting waybills are internal freights between modules present in the meeting layout:
- The station must be registered på the meeting layout.
- The station must be assiged a *region*.
- The station must have freight customers who *receives* goods that other layout stations send. Note that you don't get waybills for goods you *send*.
- If the goods customers and/or the goods flow has start and/or end date, the validity must fall within the meeting's time period.

## Resusable waybills
These are the waybill you create for your station and that can be reusedat several meetings:
- The station must be assiged a *region*.
- The station must have freight customers who *sends* or *receives* goods that other module-stations or external stations send.
- If the goods customers and/or the goods flow has start and/or end date, the validity must fall within the cargo type's validity period. 
Some cargo types has valitity for historiocal reason.
