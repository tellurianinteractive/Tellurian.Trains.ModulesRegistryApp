# Get Started
This is a short guide how to get started with the Module Registry.

### Why Bother?
There exists many ways to administer data and drawings about modules: 
Excel sheets, local databases other more or less private solutions.
The Module Registry is an open and always online alternative to private solutions.

### This is the Module Registry
The Module Registry is a *free online web application* packed with features to make
management of module data and module meetings easy for any scale and theme.
The application integrates almost all aspects of module management except 
for the scheduling planning part:
- **Modules** can be specified in great detail and documentation and drawings can be uploaded.
Modules can be joint owned by several person or a group, and ownership can be transferred.
- **Stations** can be specified with almost all operating aspects: tracks, freight customers and the cargo flow.
Waybills can be managed for each freight customer.
- **Collaborative** work is built into the application. Modules can be administred by group members on behalf of persons
that for some reason doesn't want to do it themselves.
Users can the register for participation in meetings, select a layout and register modules.
- **Module Meetings** administration, to create and manage module meetings, add track layouts,
manage particpants and registered modules.
- **Background data** is predefined data used to describe modules and stations in a structured way that makes data entry simpler. 
Here are some examples: 
*module standards*
*scale*, 
*functional state*, 
*landscape state*, 
*overhead line type*,
*signal feature*,
*landscape season*,
*end profiles*,
*track operation directions*,
*cargo types with NHM-codes*,
*loading- and unloading ready times*,
*cargo transport unit*,
*cargo packaging unit*,
*operating days*,
*regions in countries*
etc.
- **Rich Language Support**, the application is made to be multilanguage 
and now fully supports English, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish.
Partial support for Polish, Dutch, French, and Italian.
- **The Documentation** is extensive to assist your usage. 
Help texts are available on most forms, mostly of them in all fully supported languages.
There is also an English only WIKI with more general content. 
All documentation and application code is *open source*.

### Get a User Account
To be able to login, you need a user account. You cannot register as a user your self. 
Instead, you send a request to an administrator in your country of residence.
You find their names on the [Contact](/Contact) page. 
When an administrator approves your application, you will get an email with a link to where to can create
your user account. Then you can login and start using the Module Registry.

### Start Entering Your Modules
If you own modules, you can start entering data about them under *My modules*.
Click on the **?** in top right of the page to see help instructions.
If you have a station or operation location module, including junctions, you first enter the module part, then create a *operation location* that
refers to that module. Any module with some function or where time is registered is usually regarded as a *operation location*.

You can upload drawings in DWG-format for your module, a PDF document with operations documentation of your station.
The documetation should be a complement to the data you enter, so avoid writing things that you can enter as data.
During entering of your modules and stations, you will learn about all the data that is possible to enter.
Many items are drop-downs with predefined values, others are checkboxes and a few entries are free text. 

### Adding Freight Customers
Freights is a vital part of running trains at a module meeting. Freights are described with waybills, 
and in order to create waybills, you must add freight customers at your operation location.
For each freight customer, you can specify what goods they send and/or receive, and in what quantities.
The data you enter is then used to create matching waybills with freight customer at other stations.

### Register Yourself to a Module Meeting
You can select a module meeting and register your participation and optionally also register some or all
of your modules to a layout that the meeting organiser expect to build.
You can also create waybills specific for the layout. 
These waybills are meeting specific internal freights only, and can be a supplement for your other waybills.
