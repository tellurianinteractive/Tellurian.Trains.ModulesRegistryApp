## Modules and Operation locations
**This article provides an overview of how to best enter data
about your modules and operation locations in the Module Registry.**

### What defines a module?
When entering module data in the Module Register, think of a module
as a track piece that has a *standard end profile* at its ends.
This means that the module can be connected to any other module with
a compatible end profile.

 
A *module* can also consist of more than one section.
A good example is a *station module*, which has standard end profiles at the outer ends,
but non-standard internal module joints.

#### Variants of a module
Sometimes a multi-section module can be combined in several variants.
Perhaps the order of the internal sections can be changed, or some sections can be omitted.

The module register supports module variants. You can use the same module name for all variants,
but provide separate data, documentation and drawings for each variant.

Regarding cargo customers, only register these in the largest or full variant of your module. 
When you use a smaller variant, simply do not use waybills that don't apply.

### When is a module also a an operation location?
All modules that have a *traffic operational function* should also be listed as an *operation location* in the module register.
Operation characteristics are things that affect train control and scheduling.
Examples of operation locations are:
- A *branch*, i.e. a module with a switch to at least one siding or a junction.
- A *stop*, a place where trains eventually have to stop, like a halt or station, 
- A *shunting yard*, also a *shadow yard*.

#### Operation location documentation
You should provide the following documentation for your operation location:
- How to start, use and shut down the control system.
- A sketch with space for each shipping customer and places to park freight wagons for loading or unloading.

In the Module Registry, you can document the location of the loading or unloading locations
with text and a background color.
If you do, the waybills will also include it,
which, along with your sketch, makes it easy for the shift staff
to know where the freight wagons should be placed.


#### Variants of an Operation location
A variant of a operation location is essentially a variant of the module.
However, there are a few additional things to consider:
- *Freight customers*: You must enter all freight customers and their load flow on
largest variant, and nothing on the other variants.
When you then create and print waybills, you get a complete set.
If you then attend a module meeting with a smaller variant, you simply do not use
waybills for the shipping customers who are not in that variant.
- *Instructions*: If necessary, adapt documentation for each variant.
