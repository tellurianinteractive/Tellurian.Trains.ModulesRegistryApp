# Manage Module Meetings
With the Module Registry it is possible to manage your module meetings:
- Create a meeting with start and end date, and a description or external link to meeting description. 
The meeting is published in the meeting calender. 
A module meeting has an organising group, and can be created and managed by members of that group that has the right to arrange meetings.
You can set the times for when participants with modules must be at the venue.
- Add track layouts that will be operated, with first and last registration dates.
Users can then register to the meeting and register modules to track layouts. 
The meeting administrators can also add and change participants and their module registrations.
It is possible to set days of participation with latest arrival time the first day and earliest departure time the last day.
Participants can only register modules if they are present the required time specified for the meeting.
- The meeting administrator can list meeting participants and which track layouts they are registered to participate in.
The latter listr also includes all registerd modules, with summary data of each module.  
The lists can be filter and printed, for example printed to PDF and sent to the participants to verify their registration. 
It is also possible to send mail or copy mailadresses to particpants in the meeting or only to participants in a specific track layout.
These mails will sent through your private mail.

## Other Options
If you only want to publish a module meeting in the calendar, you just add the meeting data. 
It is not required to add track layouts. 
However, if you do, unmark them as *open for registration*.
Then, the track layout names will appear in the calendar, but no registration of participants will be possible.

You don't have to use the meeting and track layout free text descriptions. 
If you instead add an *extenal link* for the meeting, this page will open in a separate browser window.
