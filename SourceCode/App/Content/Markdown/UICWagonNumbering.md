# UIC Standard for Loco- and Wagon Numbering
Simplified to only concern Europe and model train operation.
## Overview
|Type of rolling stock|Type of vehicle and interoperability|Country|Class|Serial number|Checkdigit|                                                      
|---------------------|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:---:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|Freight wagons|00-89|01-99|0000-9999|000-999|0-9|
|Hauled passenger cars|50-79|01-99|0000-9999|001-999|0-9|
Tractive rolling stock|90-99|01-99||0000001-9999999 meaning is country dependent|0-9
|Special vehicles|90-99|01-99|0000-9999|001-999|0-9|

In a given country, the 7 digits of technical characteristics and serial number are sufficient 
to identify uniquely a vehicle inside each group of freight wagons, 
hauled passenger vehicles, tractive rolling stock and special vehicles.

## Interoperability Codes
Interoperability codes describe how a wagon/car can be used.
