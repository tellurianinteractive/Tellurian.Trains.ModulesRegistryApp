## Help - Register Modules

You can register your own modules and group owned modules that the group administrator permits you to borrow.

**Avaliable modules** are the *module packages* that are available but not yet registered for the track layout.
The list is populated with *module packages* that have the same *scale* as the track layout.
A *module package* contains modules with same *box label* or all *variants* of a module, 
so it can contain more than one module.

**Registered modules** are the modules you have registered for the track layout.
You can withdraw modules until the registration closes, 
as long as they are not assigned to a *position* in the layout or has the note *bring anyway*.

If you need to change or withdraw modules after the registration is closed,
you must contact the person responible for planning the track layout.

#### As Meeting Organiser
The administrators of the meeting can register and cancel modules also after the registration is closed.
