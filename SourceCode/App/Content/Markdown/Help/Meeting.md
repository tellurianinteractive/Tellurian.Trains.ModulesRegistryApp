## Help - Module Meeting
A *module meeting* is a single occasion with a start and an end date.
The module meeting is organised by a *group*, and can be created by a *group member* that is given 
the right to do so. 
The meeting is shown in the meeting calendar.
The meeting can be marked as internal to the group, and is then only visible to logged in group members.
> NOTE: You will not be able to change the meeting dates when modules are registered 
> or later that seven days before the first date of the meeting.
> This can only be made by country administrators.
### Layouts
A *layout* is a complete set of tracks operated as one unit and separate from other layouts.
You can add any number of layouts to a meeting.
Each layout can have a resposible group, that is different from the meeting organiser group.

You can permit users to register modules to a layout, and first and last date when registration is open.
The meeting will be open for registration as long as any layout is open for registration.

There should be a layout per different scale or theme.
It is also possible to break down a larger layout to separate layouts when there are distinct parts in a larger layout,
for example on layout for each country represented in the layout.
> NOTE: Dividing a larger layout into separate layouts means that you loose
> some functionality provided in the Module Registry, for example *internal waybills* across the larger layout.
