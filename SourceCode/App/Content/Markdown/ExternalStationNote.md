Please note:
- External stations **must** represent a real station, have real freight customers, and actual freight that these customers received or sent.
- External stations, their freight customers and freight must also be limited to the time period they existed.
- An external station **must** be associated with the region and country where it is actually located. The region cannot be changed after the station is saved.
